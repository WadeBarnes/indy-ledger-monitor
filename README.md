# Indy Ledger Monitor

Indy Ledger Monitor is a set of tools for fetching transactions from an Indy Ledger by querying the validators of the ledger. Based on that, requests can be made for ledger transactions such as:

* fetch pool ledger transactions
* fetch main ledger transaction(s)
* fetch schema id details
* fetch credential definition details
* fetch revocation details
* fetch NYM details

The repo has basic tools to collect and format data and tools for using that data in different ways.
