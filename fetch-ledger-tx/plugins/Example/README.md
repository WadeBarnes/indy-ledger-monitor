# Example

The [Example Plug-in](example.py) is to be used as a template to build your own plug-ins. All this does is add `"Example plug-in has run."` to the end of the result. This example is built as a package, but you can build plug-ins as a module like the maintx Plug-in.   

Be sure to make a copy before you start building. 

## How To Use
`./run.sh --net ssn --example`

--example: enables the plug-in

## Example Print Out
```
[
  "Example plug-in has run."
]
```
